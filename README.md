Hereâ€™s the updated structure with a list-style explanation of each file in the project:
# Python Flask Basic App with Docker

This is a simple Python Flask application packaged with Docker. The app serves the message **"Python Flask Basic App, Hello World!"** when accessed via a web browser.

## Project Structure

- **`python-flask-basic-app/`**
  - **`app.py`**: The Flask application code. It defines the Flask app and its routes. When accessed, it will display the message "Python Flask Basic App, Hello World!".
  - **`Dockerfile`**: The Docker configuration file to build the Docker image. It specifies how the application is set up in the Docker container.
  - **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing the Python dependencies required to run the Flask application. This includes Flask itself.
  - **`README.md`**: The documentation file for the project. It explains the purpose of the project, the steps to build and run it, and other necessary details.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), though it's not strictly needed since Docker handles the environment

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the repository (if applicable)
If you haven't already, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd python-flask-basic-app
```

### 2. Build the Docker image

Run the following command to build the Docker image with the name `python-flask-basic-app`:

```bash
docker build -t python-flask-basic-app .
```

This will build the Docker image using the instructions in the `Dockerfile`.

### 3. Run the Docker container

After the image is built, you can run the Flask app inside a Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 5007:5007 python-flask-basic-app
```

This command will run the container and expose the Flask app on port `5007`.

### 4. Access the Flask app

Open a web browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:5007
```

You should see the message:

```
Python Flask Basic App, Hello World!
```

## Project Details

- **Flask version:** 2.3.2
- **Python version:** 3.9
- **Docker version:** 20.10+

## How It Works

- The Flask app is a simple Python web application that listens on port `5007` and returns the message: **"Python Flask Basic App, Hello World!"**.
- The Dockerfile specifies Python 3.9 as the base image, installs the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and runs the Flask app.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`)
6. Create a new Pull Request

### Project Structure (List Explanation):
- **`app.py`**: Contains the Flask application and route that returns the message.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Configuration to build the Docker image.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python dependencies like Flask.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation that provides instructions and details about the project.

This structure is clearer in a list format for each file and its purpose.
